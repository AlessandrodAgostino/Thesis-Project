In this paper, we discuss the kinematics of such processes and discuss the classification of kinematic chains using ideas from algebra and group theory. Earlier work on the role of Lie groups in mechanisms is contained in Herv{\'e} [7], but the role of Lie algebras is not considered by this author. More relevant (but less group theoretic) is the extensive case-by-case analysis found in Pieper's thesis [9]. In fact, Pieper's work suggests an interesting and rather general problem in Galois theory which is directly related to manipulation. Also of interest is the well-known Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula for the derivative of a product of exponentials since such products are of fundamental importance in the study of kinematic programming.",

The operation of each algorithm is discussed and the resulting RVEs are examined from both a mechanical and a morphological perspective. A basic Voronoi-based algorithm is found to be simple to implement but the method is shown to produce inherently anisotropic microstructures. Increasing the degree of irregularity of the microstructure reduces the anisotropy but at the cost of creating unrealistic microstructures, containing highly angular cells. A method of modifying such unrealistic microstructures using a centroidal tessellation relaxation algorithm is demonstrated, ultimately producing RVEs with relatively realistic mono-disperse microstructures. An alternative algorithm is also investigated the advantage of this algorithm is its ability to generate poly-disperse microstructures, with a controllable degree of poly-dispersity and an almost fully isotropic mechanical response."

Given a mathematical or computational model y=f(x1,x2,…,xk), where the input factors xi's are uncorrelated with one another, one can see y as the realization of a stochastic process obtained by sampling each of the xi from its marginal distribution. The sensitivity indices are related to the decomposition of the variance of y into terms either due to each xi taken singularly (first order indices), as well as into terms due to the cooperative effects of more than one xi. In this paper we assume that one has computed the full set of first order sensitivity indices as well as the full set of total-order sensitivity indices (a fairly common strategy in sensitivity analysis), and show that in this case the same set of model evaluations can be used to compute double estimates of: &#x02022;the total effect of two factors taken together, for all such k2 couples, where k is the dimensionality of the model;&#x02022;the total effect of k−2 factors taken together, for all k2 such (k−2) ples. We further introduce a new strategy for the computation of the full sets of first plus total order sensitivity indices that is about 50% cheaper in terms of model evaluations with respect to previously published works. We discuss separately the case where the input factors xi's are not independent from each other."

    abstract = "Variance based methods have assessed themselves as versatile and effective among the various available techniques for sensitivity analysis of model output. Practitioners can in principle describe the sensitivity pattern of a model Y=f(X1,X2,…,Xk) with k uncertain input factors via a full decomposition of the variance V of Y into terms depending on the factors and their interactions. More often practitioners are satisfied with computing just k first order effects and k total effects, the latter describing synthetically interactions among input factors. In sensitivity analysis a key concern is the computational cost of the analysis, defined in terms of number of evaluations of f(X1,X2,…,Xk) needed to complete the analysis, as f(X1,X2,…,Xk) is often in the form of a numerical model which may take long processing time. While the computational cost is relatively cheap and weakly dependent on k for estimating first order effects, it remains expensive and strictly k-dependent for total effect indices. In the present note we compare existing and new practices for this index and offer recommendations on which to use."
